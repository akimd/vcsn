usage: vcsn COMMAND ARGS...

COMMAND can be:

- notebook: run Vcsn as an IPython Notebook.
- python, ipython: run Python/IPython.
- gdb: run gdb with a type pretty-printer.

- compile: compile a C++ program using libvcsn.
- run: set up the environment to find Vcsn, and run the ARGS...
- ps: display Vcsn compilation jobs.
- demangle: improve readability of C++ compiler error messages.

- efstcompile, efstdecompile: compile/decompile EFST files

- version: display version tag.

- score, score-compare: generate/compare benchmarks.

- $(commands | sed -e '1s/^  //'):
  run the corresponding algorithm.

For more information, run:

  $ vcsn COMMAND -h

For instance:

  $ vcsn derived-term -C 'lal_char(abc), b' -e '(a+b+a)*' |
     vcsn determinize |
     vcsn minimize |
     vcsn to-expression
