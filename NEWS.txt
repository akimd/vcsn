** standard-of
Initial version of standard-of is implemented.  Can be tested with
pprat's new option -s:

  $ pprat -wz -s '{123}a'
  digraph A {
    rankdir=LR
    node [shape=circle];
    1
    I1 [style=invis,shape=none,label="",width=0,height=0]
    I1 -> 1
    2
    F2 [style=invis,shape=none,label="",width=0,height=0]
    2 -> F2
    1 -> 2 [label="{123}a"]
  }

** mutable_automaton uses unsigned for state_t and transition_t.

This allows to store states in a std::vector<stored_state_t>.
Likewise for transitions.  Erased elements are marked (so they are
skipped over during iteration), and added to a free store to be reused
later.

** mutable_automaton does not store any weight when WeightSet == b.

** make check-rat, make check-unit

There is a check target for each subdirectory of tests/.

** Alphabets are checked
pprat is hard-coded to use a, b, c, d for all the alphabets
(including for inner rational expressions):

  $ pprat -w b -e 'y'
  1.1: invalid word: y: invalid letter: y

** Weights are checked
As follows:

  $ pprat -w b -e '{12}a'
  1.1-5: invalid Boolean: 12

Unfortunately the locations are bad currently for complex weights:

  $ pprat -w zr -e '{x}a'
  1.1-4: 1.1: invalid word: x: invalid letter: x

To be fixed.

** G++ 4.7 is required
We use constructs that are not supported by 4.6 (e.g., constructor
delegation).

** zrr
As a demonstration that rational expressions can be weights of
rational expressions, pprat supports '-w zrr' (Rat<Rat<Z>>):

   $ pprat -w zr -e '{{{2}{3}a}u}x{{{4}{5}\e}\e}'
   {{{120}a}u}x
