** G++ 4.7 is required
We use constructs that are not supported by 4.6 (e.g., constructor
delegation).

** zrr
As a demonstration that rational expressions can be weights of
rational expressions, pprat supports '-w zrr' (Rat<Rat<Z>>):

   $ pprat -w zr -e '{{{2}{3}a}u}x{{{4}{5}\e}\e}'
   {{{120}a}u}x
