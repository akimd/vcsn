The VCSN virtual machine				-*- outline -*-

The following directory contains the infrastructure for creating
vritual machines capable of compiling Vcsn; and running the
Notebook.  The following are strict requirements to successfully
create a virtual machine:

  - VirtualBox (http://virtualbox.org/)

  - Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com/)

The end result is something that can be easily distributed and
installed by anyone following the instructions under VM/README

With that said, all you need to do is run `make' and VM/ will contain
a virtual machine and all auxiliary files that one can distribute to
users.

You can also run `make vcsn-bootstrap', which will create a temporary
virtual machine that can be connected to using the normal vagrant
commands.

Short summary of vagrant commands:

  - vagrant up :: brings up the virtual machine.

  - vagrant ssh :: connects to the virtual machine using ssh

  - vagrant halt :: stops the virtual machine.

  - vagrant destroy :: removes it from permanently.

Some notes on the files that are in this directory:

VM/vcsn.box is the full installation, with VCSN compiled.  This file
  is large (~1G) so it is best.  This, and VM/Vagrantfile (see below)
  would be what is distributed to users.

VM/Vagrantfile contains instructions for `vagrant' for setting up the
  VCSN virtual machine.

The following files are only useful for people who want to create
`vcsn.box':

unstable64.box is a `clean' installation of Debian (unstable); patched
  for Vagrant use.  See README.unstable64 (attached) for instructions
  on how it was created.  This base box can be downloaded from
  minsky:~ams/unstable64.box.

Vagrantfile contains the instructions for Vagrant that it needs to
  execute.  This file might need to be edited depending on what kind
  of machine is being used to build.  It is used by `vagrant' for
  setting up the unstable64 virtual machine.

vcsn-bootstrap.sh contains commands to install any build dependencies
  required for VCSN; fetch the latest version of VCSN; and finally
  fires up the notebook.
