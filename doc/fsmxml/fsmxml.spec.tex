\section{Terminology}

\subsection{General}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{MUST}

  This word, or the terms \emph{REQUIRED} or \emph{SHALL}, mean that
  the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

\item \emph{MUST NOT}

  This phrase, or the phrase \emph{SHALL NOT}, mean that the
  definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.

\item \emph{SHOULD}

  This word, or the adjective \emph{RECOMMENDED}, mean that there may
  exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
  particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
  carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

\item \emph{SHOULD NOT}

  This phrase, or the phrase \emph{NOT RECOMMENDED} mean that there
  may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the
  particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full
  implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed
  before implementing any behavior described with this label.

\item \emph{MAY}

  This word, or the adjective \emph{OPTIONAL}, mean that an item is
  truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a
  particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that
  it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.
  An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be
  prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does
  include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In
  the same vein an implementation which does include a particular
  option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation
  which does not include the option (except, of course, for the
  feature the option provides).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{FSMXML}

Each element of the FSMXML format is described in a section with the
following 2 parts:

\subsubsection{Children}

Describes the required/allowed children of the element, their number
of occurrences and a brief description of what they stand for.

\subsubsection{Attributes}

The attributes of the element are listed in a table like the following:
\\\attrs{}
\\in which:

\paragraph*{Name}
Gives the name of the attribute.

\paragraph*{Info}
Gives informations about the attribute:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Required}

The attribute is mandatory.

\item \emph{Pivot}

  Depending on the attribute's value, the form of the children should
  differ.

\item \emph{Unique}

  When the same element can be used more than once, it means that one
  shall not declare twice the same value in each of those elements.

\item \emph{Valid}

  Implies that the value must have already been defined previously in
  the XML document.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Type}
Gives the type of the value:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{token}

  Is used for a string which takes only a couple of already defined
  values, listed in the \emph{Values} column.

\item \emph{ID}

  Is used for a string which represents an identifier, that can be
  used many times in the document to refer to the unique same
  ``concept''.

\item \emph{generator}

  Is used for a string which only takes a couple of values
  (implicitly) defined in the XML document.

\item \emph{weight}

  Is used for a string which only takes a couple of values
  (implicitly) defined in the XML document.

\item \emph{URI}

  A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), is a compact string of
  characters used to identify or name a resource.

\item \emph{integer}, \emph{float}, \emph{string}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Default}
Since some attributes are always required and would usually take the
same value, a default value is possible. Omitting the attribute will
implicitly stand for the default value.

\paragraph*{Values}
When \emph{Type} is set to \xval{token}, lists all the possible values
that can take the attribute.

\paragraph*{Description}
Gives a complete description of the attribute.

\newpage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{FSMXML}

\subsection{\xtag{fsmxml}}
\label{fsmxml}

The top-level \emph{root} element, which carries version information,
etc. \example{automatonA1}{1 and 72}.

  \attr{version}{}{float}{none}{}{Sets the version of FSMXML used.
    This one is \version}
}

\subsubsection*{Children}
\children{

  \child{expression}{A regular expression. Occurs 0 or more
    times.}{expression}.

  \child{automaton}{An automaton. Occurs 0 or more times.}{automaton}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Type}

Regular expressions and automata are described over a type, which can
be described in the same way for both objects. In FSMXML this type is
described by the following elements:

\subsection{\xtag{valueType}}
\label{valueType}

The top-level element of the type part. \example{automatonA1}{5-16}.

\subsubsection*{Attributes}
None.

\subsubsection*{Attributes}
\attrs{
  \attr{type}{Required, Pivot}{token}{none}{``unit'', ``free'',
    ``product''} {Type of the labelSet.}
}

\subsubsection{Unit Label Set}

When \xattr{type} is set to ``unit'', it is equivalent to the lack of
label sets. It enables the possibility to describe valued graphs
within the same format.

\subsubsection{Free Label Set}
\label{freeLabelSet}

When \xattr{type} is set to ``free'', the \xtag{labelSet} describes a
free labelSet and inherits the following new attributes and children.

  \attr{genKind}{Required, Pivot}{token}{none}{``simple'', ``tuple''}
  {Kind of the generators.}
  \attr{genDescript}{Required, Pivot}{token}{``enum''}{``enum'',
    ``range'', ``set''} {How are described the generators.}
}

    times.}{labelGen}.
}

\paragraph{Free LabelSet with ``tuple'' generators}

When \xattr{type} is set to ``free'', and \xattr{genKind} to
``tuple'', the \xtag{labelSet} inherits the following new attributes

    the tuple.}

    set. Occurs 1 time, is required.}{genSort}.
  \child{labelGen}{A labelSet generator. Occurs 1 or more
    times.}{labelGen}.
}

\subsubsection{Product LabelSet}

When \xattr{type} is set to ``product'', the \xtag{labelSet} describes
a product of free label sets and inherits the following new attributes
and children. \example{automatonPhim1}{9-26}.

\attrs{
  \attr{prodDim}{Required}{integer}{none}{Greater than 1} {Dimension
    of the product.}

\label{genCompSort}

Describes the sort of the \xval{k}th coordinate/component in a
``tuple'' generator, \xval{k} being the position of the element in the
list within \xtag{genSort}. \example{automatonPdp1}{18-19}.

\subsubsection*{Attributes}
\attrs{
  \attr{value}{Required}{token}{none}{``letter'', ``digit'',
    ``integer''} {Sort of a coordinate/component of the ``tuple''
    generator.}
}
\subsubsection*{Children}
None.

\subsection{\xtag{labelGen}}
\label{labelGen}

\subsubsection{``enum'' generators}
When \xattr{genDescript} is set to ``enum'', the \xtag{labelGen}
inherits the following new attributes:

\paragraph{``enum'' generator of ``simple'' sort}

Describes a generator of label set when its \xattr{genDescript} is set
to ``enum'' and \xattr{genKind} to ``simple''.
\example{automatonA1}{13-14}.

\paragraph*{Attributes}
\attrs{
  \attr{value}{Required}{generator}{none}{}{ Gives the value of the
    generator. Should fit \xattr{genSort} restriction.  }
}

If used within a \xtag{labelSet}, should also be \emph{Unique}.  If
used within a \xtag{label}, should also be \emph{Valid}.
\paragraph*{Children}

\paragraph*{Children}
\children{
  \child{labelCompGen}{A ``tuple'' label set generator. Occurs
    \xval{genDim} times.}{labelCompGen}.
}

\subsubsection{``range'' and ``set'' generators}

Even if these \texttt{Tokens} are present in FSMXML, no further
investigations were done. Since {\sc Vaucanson} only use enumerations,
we let these investigations to more expert people.

\subsection{\xtag{labelCompGen}}
