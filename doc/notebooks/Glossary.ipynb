    "A state $s$ is accessible if there is a path from an initial state to $s$.\n",

    "A lightening cycle is a path from a state to itself that is either negative (for $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}$), or between 0 and 1 (for $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R}_\\text{min}$).\n",

    "A labelset is free if the labels are only \"letters\".  This is a requirement for algorithms such as `determinize`, `evaluate`.\n",

    "## is_letterized\n",
    "A labelset is letterized if it free, or nullable of free.  In other words, its labels are either letters, or the empty word.  Maybe surprisingly, oneset ($\\{1\\}$) is letterized.\n",
