    "\n",

    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "    VCSN_DEBUG=1 ./_build/35s/tests/bin/vcsn run gdb --args python -c \"import vcsn;\n",

    "\n",
    "### OpenFST\n",
    "\n",
    "When benching against OpenFST, do not use the convenient `automaton.fstFOO` functions.  For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    vcsn = [time(lambda : a.synchronize())    for a in auts]\n",
    "    ofst = [time(lambda : a.fstsynchronize()) for a in auts]\n",

    "       for fst in [a.as_fst() for a in auts]]\n",
    "\n",
    "as it converts to FST format only once (and outside the benchmark command), and does not try to convert the result back to Vcsn.  Actually, it does not even try to save the result at all (`/dev/null`), since Vcsn does not try to save its result either.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IPython\n",
    "See also the page [Widgets](Widgets.ipynb) to know more about the development of IPython Widgets.\n",

    "## Commits\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a number of rules to follow:\n",
    "- one purpose per commit\n",
    "- space changes are one purpose, therefore a separate commit\n",
    "- commit should have a title which looks like \"_topic_: _what_\" where\n",
    "  - topic is something like `doc`, `dyn`, `determinize`, `expression`, `style` (for space changes, etc.)...\n",
    "  - what is a sentence, starting with a lower case letter, telling what this change is about\n",
    "- commits then follow with text explaining the motivations for the commit\n",
