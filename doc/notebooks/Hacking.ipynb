    "  hyper-short) names for long-lived entities (e.g., function names,\n",

    "\n",
    "It is possible to use ASAN, but there are quite a few tricky issues.\n",
    "- be sure to pass `-fsanitize=address` in `CXX`, not `CXXFLAGS`, because otherwise `libtool` tends to move it.\n",
    "- ASAN must be loaded from the top-level executable.  This is fine for TAF-Kit (so `vcsn standard -Ee a` for instance properly loads asan), but it is not for Python, since, it is unlikely that your Python was linked against ASAN.  So you need to preload it, e.g., `LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/clang/3.8.0/lib/linux/libclang_rt.asan-x86_64.so`.\n",
    "- Python and Boost.Python seem to leak.  I have tried to use the LSAN (leak sanitizer) suppression files, but with limited success.  For a start, I used `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0` to disable LSAN.\n",

    "### VCSN_PARENS\n",
    "Force the display of useless parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VCSN_PLUGINDIR [VCSN_HOME/plugins]\n",
    "Where the runtime context instantiation are generated and compiled.\n",

    "### VCSN_PRINT\n",
    "Force a more verbose display of expression (XML like), where one can\n",
    "actually see the nesting of the structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VCSN_PYTHONDIR\n",
    "The python directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VCSN_SEED\n",

    "\n",
    "### VERBOSE\n",
    "Make the test suite more verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### YYDEBUG, YYSCAN\n",
    "Set to enable Bison parser/ Flex scanner tracing.  Can be an integer\n",
    "to denote nesting (which is useful for instance for dot parsing which\n",
    "can fire expression parsing: specify how many layers you want to make\n",
    "verbose).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the test suite, 4 processes in parallel (e.g., if you have 4\n",
    "threads like with an i7), run\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ make -j4 check\n",
    "\n",
    "To run some of the tests (e.g., tafkit/determinize.chk), run\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ make -j4 tests/python/determinize.log\n",
    "    \n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ make -j4 check TESTS=tests/python/determinize.py\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter will create `tests/test-suite.log` and `tests/python/determinize.log`, the former only the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both will run `make all`, which can take a while.  If you know what you are doing (for instance you want to check something which is compiled at runtime), you can avoid this `make all` by running the test by hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ ./_build/tests/bin/vcsn -e tests/python/determinize.py\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also run only the unit/rat/demo/tafkit tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ make -j4 check-tafkit\n",
    "\n",
    "### To create a new test case\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new test case is quite easy: select the proper file (usually the name of the `tests/python/*.py` is clear enough, but make sure with `git grep ALGO tests/python` if the ALGO is not actually tested in a less obvious place), then do as you see with the other tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To create a new test file\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid creating too many files.  For instance `prefix` and `suffix` do not deserve two different files, they can both live in `prefix.py` for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create the file `tests/python/foo.py` by copying some existing file\n",
    "2. make sure it is executable\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ chmod +x tests/python/foo.py\n",
    "\n",
    "3. add this file to the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git add tests/python/foo.py\n",
    "\n",
    "4. add this file to the list of tests in `tests/python/local.mk`, respect the alphabetical order\n",
    "5. run just this test to make sure that everything is ok\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ ./_build/35s/tests/bin/vcsn -e tests/python/foo.py\n",
    "\n",
    "### To debug\n",
    "\n",
    "The script `_build/35s/tests/bin/vcsn` defines the environment needed to run a non-installed version of Vcsn.  To debug a Python program, use this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ./_build/35s/tests/bin/vcsn run gdb --args python -c \"import vcsn;\n",
    "    vcsn.context('lal_char(ab), b').expression('[^]*a').derived_term()\n",
    "\n",
    "for instance.  To run a TAF-Kit command under Valgrind:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ./_build/35s/tests/bin/vcsn run valgrind ./_build/35s/bin/vcsn-tafkit cat -Ee a\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that the debug symbols (at least on OS X) are in the `*.o` file, not the `*.so` file.  And the `*.o` is removed when the compilation succeeded.  To keep it, be sure to enable `VCSN_DEBUG`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    VCSN_DEBUG=1 ./_build/35s/tests/bin/vcsn run gdb --args python -c \"import vcsn;\n",
    "    vcsn.context('lal_char(ab), b').expression('[^]*a').derived_term()\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if your build is optimized, some variables might be optimized away.  So use `VCSN_CXXFLAGS` to change that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    VCSN_CXXFLAGS='-std=c++14 -O0 -ggdb' \\\n",
    "    VCSN_DEBUG=1 \\\n",
    "    ./_build/35s/tests/bin/vcsn run gdb --args python -c \"import vcsn;\n",
    "    vcsn.context('lal_char(ab), b').expression('[^]*a').derived_term()\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmarks\n",
    "Be sure to compile in `-O3 -DNDEBUG` for benchmarks.  Be sure that the tools with compared against (typically OpenFST) are *also* compiled this way!\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenFST\n",
    "\n",
    "When benching against OpenFST, do not use the convenient `automaton.fstFOO` functions.  For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    vcsn = [time(lambda : a.synchronize())    for a in auts]\n",
    "    ofst = [time(lambda : a.fstsynchronize()) for a in auts]\n",
    "\n",
    "is completely unfair to OpenFST.  Do this instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ofst =\n",
    "      [time(lambda : subprocess.call(['fstsynchronize', fst.name, '/dev/null']))\n",
    "       for fst in [a.as_fst() for a in auts]]\n",
    "\n",
    "as it converts to FST format only once (and outside the benchmark command), and does not try to convert the result back to Vcsn.  Actually, it does not even try to save the result at all (`/dev/null`), since Vcsn does not try to save its result either.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commits\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a number of rules to follow:\n",
    "- one purpose per commit\n",
    "- space changes are one purpose, therefore a separate commit\n",
    "- commit should have a title which looks like \"_topic_: _what_\" where\n",
    "  - topic is something like `doc`, `dyn`, `determinize`, `expression`, `style` (for space changes, etc.)...\n",
    "  - what is a sentence, starting with a lower case letter, telling what this change is about\n",
    "- commits then follow with text explaining the motivations for the commit\n",
    "  - describe the bug it fixes\n",
    "  - explain the alternatives and why this one was preferred\n",
    "  - show results of `vcsn score` that demonstrate that there is no regression/an improvement\n",
    "- commits then follow with the list of files and a concise description of the changes (with an emphasize on the why rather than paraphrasing the git log).\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to read other commit logs to understand the style and to copy it.  Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
