* debug compilation mode
crange should not feature size and empty if !VCSN_DEBUG.

* vcsn/alphabets/char.cc
  char_letters::special_letter(...) is protected and
  set_alpha<T>::add_letter(...) (in file vcsn/alphabets/setalpha.hh)
  need it.

* mutable_automaton::set_transition
We should find a mean to forbid transition from pre to post.  This was
the case initially, but it is a useless constraint in aut-to-exp.
Maybe it should be efforced only in non labels_are_empty case.

* labels_are_empty
Implement support.

* automata: handle with shared_ptr
One would rely like to have a transpose_automaton that is able to
build its underlying automaton.  This means that using a const& to
keep the original automaton is not the best model: pointers would be
better.  But then there are issues with memory tracking, issues that
we already know how to handle thanks to shared_ptr.

* rename contexts
char_b should be char_b_lal, etc.

* libraries for contexts
libvcsn-char_b_lal etc. would make the compilation of pprat etc. much
easier, and save cycles.

* compilation jit
Well, you know what I mean.

* char.hh:
choose bw "word_t w", and const&.

* move files around
vcsn/ should be headers only, move lib else.  The hierarchy and the
namespaces do not match.
