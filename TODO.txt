* debug compilation mode
crange should not feature size and empty if !VCSN_DEBUG.

* vcsn/alphabets/char.cc
  char_letters::special_letter(...) is protected and
  set_alpha<T>::add_letter(...) (in file vcsn/alphabets/setalpha.hh)
  need it.

* mutable_automaton::set_transition

the case initially, but it is a useless constraint in aut-to-exp.
Maybe it should be efforced only in non labels_are_empty case.
